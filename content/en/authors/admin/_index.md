I am currently a PhD candidate, working with [Prof. Upamanyu Madhow](https://wcsl.ece.ucsb.edu/people/upamanyu-madhow) in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department at UCSB. My research interests include machine learning, signal processing, and wireless communication. 

Through my research experience, I have developed interests in Deep Learning and its applications. I have worked so far on various areas spanning from  Deep Learning in Natural language processing and Computer Vision to Deep Q learning for game playing agents. And Currently I devoted myself to further understand the nature of neural nets and improve the adversarial robustness of neural nets.
