## What is Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a library to visualize the stuff you are interested in. It offers a number of different visualization tools ranging from simple 1d plots to interactive 3d colorful plots. This blog is still in development and contains the visualization techniques that at some point I've used. Whenever I learn a new technique, I will add that to here.

# Installation

For conda users following command is good to go:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib
```

For old-school pip:

```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
